1. the LinkedList questions and Recursive questions are often interchangeable

2. involved with LinkedList questions, there are 2 most common useful techniques,
   the runner technique and recursive technique

3. pay attention to how organize the recursive structure in linkedList question;
   for example, in ReturnKth problem, we solve current problem only if we solve the recursive
   problem (return the k-1 before return kth), so the structure is: recursive boundary -->
   recursive call --> logic process;
   but in the SumList problem(reverse), when applied recursive method, we solve current problem
   first, and then solve the recursive problem (get the ith Node and then get the i+1th Node, set
   the i+1th Node as the next of ith Node)
